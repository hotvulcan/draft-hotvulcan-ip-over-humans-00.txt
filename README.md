# draft-hotvulcan-ip-over-humans-00.txt
Experimental proposal for IP packet transport using human couriers and portable media as a physical link layer (IPoH).

This document defines a method for transmitting IP packets by means of human physical transport, treating human couriers as a link-layer abstraction. The proposed scheme, IP over Humans (IPoH), enables high-throughput but high-latency data transfer using portable storage media carried by people. It formalizes procedures for encapsulation, routing, fragmentation, TTL interpretation, delivery confirmation, and security. This draft is intended for experimental evaluation in environments where conventional network infrastructure is unavailable, air-gapped, or intentionally disconnected.
